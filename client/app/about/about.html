  		<p>I have been fortunate to study guitar under several excellent teachers including Mimi Fox, Fred Fried, Dweezil Zappa, Jonathan Kreisberg, Oz Noy, Chris Buono, Tom Quayle, Ted Dunbar, Brian Pardo, and Steve Erquiaga. </p>

  		<p>I also earned a Bachelor’s Degree in Music (and English) from Marietta College in Ohio, where I studied classical guitar while playing in numerous rock, jazz, blues, funk, folk, punk, country, and experimental bands. </p>

  		<p>In 1998 I moved to San Francisco, where I became lead guitarist for the funk ensemble Stymie and the Pimp Jones Luv Orchestra.  As both player and band manager, I helped lead the band to a SF Weekly Music Award for "Best Funk / Soul / R n’ B Band" in 2001.  In addition to playing on Stymie's first full-length album, Secret Hits of the Black and Blue Parade, I also co-wrote the song "Stumble to the Break of Lawn" which was selected as a finalist in the in the 2005 John Lennon Songwriting Competition (R&B category) and was voted "Track of the Day" on Garageband.com.</p>

  		<p>Among my professional highlights are performances alongside musical legend Billy Preston, (when the 'Fifth Beatle' hopped onstage and accompanied us on his hits "Will It Go Round In Circles" and "Nothing From Nothing") and Fred Wesley (Trombonist/Bandleader for James Brown, the JB's and Parliment / Funkadelic, who requested Stymie as his backing band for a performance at a San Francisco club).  I have also performed as the opening act for Earth, Wind, and Fire; Rufus with Chaka Khan; The Sugar Hill Gang; and members of Sly and The Family Stone and The Meters.</p>


 		<p>As an educator, I have taught guitar to students of all ages since 1996.  From 2001-2007 I was part of Marin Country Day School’s Forte music program, where I started the Forte Electric Combos, giving young kids the opportunity to play a full 30-minute set of songs by artists such as The Beatles, Rush, Frank Zappa, Herbie Hancock, The Cars, The Meters, and Cream.</p>

 		<p>Also a freelance writer, I've contributed to Guitar Player Magazine, Bass Player Magazine and Play Guitar Magazine.</p>
