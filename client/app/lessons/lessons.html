	<h1>Guitar Lessons</h1>
   	
	<h2>My approach</h2>


	<p>I still remember the day I decided to learn how to play guitar.  I had no idea what a chord was, or a fret, or how to hold a pick, but I knew there was something about this instrument that I was attracted to.  I wanted to play it, and be good at it, and make music that other people would enjoy.  But I had no idea where to start or how to express what I was trying to do.  Luckily, I found a guitar teacher who understood exactly what I was feeling, even though I couldn't put it in words. </p>

   	<p>I've been fortunate to have studied with several excellent guitar teachers across many different styles and genres of music.  Some of them are well known, and many are not, but they all shared that same passion.  As a student, my goal has been to assimilate these diverse styles and techniques into something that will ultimately be my own unique voice.  I've been working on it for most of my life, and the journey continues.</p>

   	<p>As a teacher, my job is to help you become the player you want to be, and make the music that you want to make.   Together we'll identify your goals, whatever they might be, and I will patiently guide you and enable you to possess the tools and knowledge to reach those goals. Whether you are a wide-eyed beginner struggling to keep your fingers in place, or a seasoned player looking for some inspiration to break out of a rut, I can help you understand how the guitar works, and how music works, so that you can make it work for you.</p>


	
   	<h2>When, Where, and How Much?</h2>

	<p>I currently live in the Wash Park area of Denver, CO, and offer lessons out of my home.  Alternately I can come to you if you live in the general Denver vicinity, or we can even do lessons remotely via Facetime or Skype (although for beginners I'd recommend in-person lessons). </p>
